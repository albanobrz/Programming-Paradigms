in general, the functional paradigm uses more resources than the others (imperative)
but with the better processors and computing power, the functional paradigm is being on focus nowadays
they have advantages, and the disavantage is falling behind because of better computers

declarative programing is imutable, for instance, if i have 10 elements on array and i want to push another one,
a copy of this array with the new value (11 elements) will be saved on another memory address... requires more resource than imperative programing

enviroments of multi thread are not good for oop, because there could be lots of processing over one pointer(obj)(they are mutable)
but meanwhile in FP, this is a good scenario, since all values are imutable, its more trusty
only a few problems, compared to others paradigms, about concurrency

current tech scenario:
    - lots of memory
    - multiple threads
*means good for FP*
