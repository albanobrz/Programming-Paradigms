# OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes and structures code around the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints that define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. OOP promotes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It allows for modular and reusable code, making it easier to manage and maintain complex software systems.

## Main concepts explaineds briefly

<u>Encapsulation:</u> reduce the amount of parameters a function has.
 - reduce complexity, increase reusability

<u>Abstraction:</u> using the methods inside the class, which hides complexity.
 - reduce complexity, isolate impact of changes

<u>Inheritance:</u> remove repetitive code, extending other classes.
 - eliminate redundant code

<u>Polymorphism:</u> the method is associated to the class.
 - refactor ugly switch/case statements
